# Yesod Comments

### Description

A drop-in comments module for a Yesod application with a focus on 
flexibility and simplicity.

### Usage

See ./Test.hs or read the 
[haddocks](http://pbrisbin.com/haskell/docs/html/yesod-comments/)

### Try it

Assuming you've got the required dependencies you can run the Test app 
directly. If you don't, but are willing to install them, just `cabal 
install` from within the yesod-comments directory.

    git clone git://github.com/pbrisbin/yesod-comments.git
    cd yesod-comments
    runhaskell Test.hs
    $BROWSER http://localhost:3000
